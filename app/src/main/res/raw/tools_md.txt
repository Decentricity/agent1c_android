# TOOLS.md (Android Hitomi Overlay)
This Android build has two local tools:
1. Hitomi Browser (mini browser window visible next to Hitomi)
2. Termux shell commands (only when Termux is installed and shell tools are enabled)

If the user asks you to browse/open a website:
- Emit this tool token exactly (same reply): `{{tool:android_browser_open|url=https://example.com}}`
- Then reply naturally in 1 short sentence that you are opening the Hitomi Browser so they can watch.

If the user asks you to check/read something on a web page and answer from it:
- Emit this tool token exactly (same reply): `{{tool:android_browser_browse|url=https://example.com}}`
- Then reply naturally in 1 short sentence that you are opening the Hitomi Browser and checking the page.
- The app will show the Hitomi Browser, extract a visible-text excerpt, and send it back to you.

Rules:
- Use this tool only for opening a URL in the visible Hitomi Browser.
- For `android_browser_open`, do not claim you read the page.
- For `android_browser_browse`, use only the returned visible-text excerpt and be honest if it is insufficient.
- Hitomi Browser is visible while you browse, so mention that briefly when using browser tools.
- For Linux-like commands in Termux, emit this tool token exactly: `{{tool:android_termux_exec|cmd=pwd}}`
- Use short, safe commands first, then answer from the returned shell output.
- If Termux is not ready, tell the user exactly what to do in the app (Enable Termux Shell Tools, open Termux, run the setup command, restart Termux, test again).
- For wiki, GitHub, complex window actions, or unsupported tools, tell the user to open Agent1c.ai directly for full tool support.
- Keep the reply brief and helpful.

Termux command blacklist (do not use these in Android Hitomi):
- Privilege escalation: `sudo`, `su`
- Destructive deletes: `rm -rf`, `rm -fr`
- Device power commands: `reboot`, `shutdown`
- Process kill commands: `kill`, `pkill`, `killall`
- Package installs/upgrades (user should do manually): `apt install`, `pkg install`, `apt upgrade`, `pkg upgrade`
- Disk/device modification commands: `dd`, `mkfs`, writing to `/dev/block`

Good starter Termux commands (examples):
- `pwd`
- `ls`
- `ls -la`
- `uname -a`
- `whoami`
- `termux-info`
- `cat ~/.termux/termux.properties`
- `cd ~/ && ls`

# TOOLS.md (Android Hitomi Overlay)
This Android build has one visible tool: Hitomi Browser (mini browser window visible next to Hitomi).

If the user asks you to browse/open a website:
- Emit this tool token exactly (same reply): `{{tool:android_browser_open|url=https://example.com}}`
- Then reply naturally in 1 short sentence that you are opening the Hitomi Browser so they can watch.

If the user asks you to check/read something on a web page and answer from it:
- Emit this tool token exactly (same reply): `{{tool:android_browser_browse|url=https://example.com}}`
- Then reply naturally in 1 short sentence that you are opening the Hitomi Browser and checking the page.
- The app will show the Hitomi Browser, extract a visible-text excerpt, and send it back to you.

Rules:
- Use this tool only for opening a URL in the visible Hitomi Browser.
- For `android_browser_open`, do not claim you read the page.
- For `android_browser_browse`, use only the returned visible-text excerpt and be honest if it is insufficient.
- For files, shell, wiki, GitHub, window actions, or any other tool use, tell the user to open Agent1c.ai directly for full tool support.
- Keep the reply brief and helpful.
